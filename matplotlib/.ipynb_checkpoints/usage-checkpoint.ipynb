    "General Concepts\n",
    "================\n",
    "\n",
    ":mod:`matplotlib` has an extensive codebase that can be daunting to many\n",
    "new users. However, most of matplotlib can be understood with a fairly\n",
    "simple conceptual framework and knowledge of a few important points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting requires action on a range of levels, from the most general\n",
    "(e.g., 'contour this 2-D array') to the most specific (e.g., 'color\n",
    "this screen pixel red'). The purpose of a plotting package is to assist\n",
    "you in visualizing your data as easily as possible, with all the necessary\n",
    "control -- that is, by using relatively high-level commands most of\n",
    "the time, and still have the ability to use the low-level commands when\n",
    "needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, everything in matplotlib is organized in a hierarchy. At the top\n",
    "of the hierarchy is the matplotlib \"state-machine environment\" which is\n",
    "provided by the :mod:`matplotlib.pyplot` module. At this level, simple\n",
    "functions are used to add plot elements (lines, images, text, etc.) to\n",
    "the current axes in the current figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Pyplot's state-machine environment behaves similarly to MATLAB and\n",
    "   should be most familiar to users with MATLAB experience.</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The next level down in the hierarchy is the first level of the object-oriented\n",
    "interface, in which pyplot is used only for a few functions such as figure\n",
    "creation, and the user explicitly creates and keeps track of the figure\n",
    "and axes objects. At this level, the user uses pyplot to create figures,\n",
    "and through those figures, one or more axes objects can be created. These\n",
    "axes objects are then used for most plotting actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For even more control -- which is essential for things like embedding\n",
    "matplotlib plots in GUI applications -- the pyplot level may be dropped\n",
    "completely, leaving a purely object-oriented approach.\n"

    "Interactive example\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "From an ordinary python prompt, or after invoking ipython with no options,\n",
    "try this::\n",
    "\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",

    "    plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you are running version 1.0.1 or higher, and you have\n",
    "an interactive backend installed and selected by default, you should\n",
    "see a plot, and your terminal prompt should also be active; you\n",
    "can type additional commands such as::\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.title(\"interactive test\")\n",
    "    plt.xlabel(\"index\")\n",
    "\n",
    "and you will see the plot being updated after each line.  Since version 1.5,\n",

    "\n",
    "    ax = plt.gca()\n",
    "    ax.plot([3.1, 2.2])\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using certain backends (like `macosx`), or an older version\n",

    "In this case, you need to explicitly call :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw`\n",
    "in order to update the plot::\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.draw()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-interactive example\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a fresh session as in the previous example, but now\n",
    "turn interactive mode off::\n",
    "\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "    plt.ioff()\n",
    "    plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing happened--or at least nothing has shown up on the\n",
    "screen (unless you are using *macosx* backend, which is\n",
    "anomalous).  To make the plot appear, you need to do this::\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you see the plot, but your terminal command line is\n",
    "unresponsive; the :func:`show()` command *blocks* the input\n",
    "of additional commands until you manually kill the plot\n",
    "window.\n",
    "\n",
    "What good is this--being forced to use a blocking function?\n",
    "Suppose you need a script that plots the contents of a file\n",
    "to the screen.  You want to look at that plot, and then end\n",
    "the script.  Without some blocking command such as show(), the\n",
    "script would flash up the plot and then end immediately,\n",
    "leaving nothing on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, non-interactive mode delays all drawing until\n",
    "show() is called; this is more efficient than redrawing\n",
    "the plot each time a line in the script adds a new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to version 1.0, show() generally could not be called\n",
    "more than once in a single script (although sometimes one\n",
    "could get away with it); for version 1.0.1 and above, this\n",
    "restriction is lifted, so one can write a script like this::\n",
    "\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.ioff()\n",

    "\n",
    "which makes three plots, one at a time. I.e. the second plot will show up,\n",
    "once the first plot is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "In interactive mode, pyplot functions automatically draw\n",
    "to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "When plotting interactively, if using\n",
    "object method calls in addition to pyplot functions, then\n",
    "call :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw` whenever you want to\n",
    "refresh the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use non-interactive mode in scripts in which you want to\n",
    "generate one or more figures and display them before ending\n",
    "or generating a new set of figures.  In that case, use\n",
    ":func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.show` to display the figure(s) and\n",
    "to block execution until you have manually destroyed them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance\n",
    "===========\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether exploring data in interactive mode or programmatically\n",
    "saving lots of plots, rendering performance can be a painful\n",
    "bottleneck in your pipeline. Matplotlib provides a couple\n",
    "ways to greatly reduce rendering time at the cost of a slight\n",
    "change (to a settable tolerance) in your plot's appearance.\n",
    "The methods available to reduce rendering time depend on the\n",
    "type of plot that is being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line segment simplification\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For plots that have line segments (e.g. typical line plots,\n",
    "outlines of polygons, etc.), rendering performance can be\n",
    "controlled by the ``path.simplify`` and\n",
    "``path.simplify_threshold`` parameters in your\n",

    "The ``path.simplify`` parameter is a boolean indicating whether\n",
    "or not line segments are simplified at all. The\n",
    "``path.simplify_threshold`` parameter controls how much line\n",

    "\n",
    "Matplotlib currently defaults to a conservative simplification\n",
    "threshold of ``1/9``. If you want to change your default settings\n",
    "to use a different value, you can change your ``matplotlibrc``\n",
    "file.  Alternatively, you could create a new style for\n",
    "interactive plotting (with maximal simplification) and another\n",
    "style for publication quality plotting (with minimal\n",
    "simplification) and activate them as necessary. See\n",
    ":doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing` for\n",

    "Marker simplification\n",
    "---------------------\n",
